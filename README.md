## Warning!

This project is a free and open-source initiative maintained by a group of volunteers. It is provided "as is" without any warranties or guarantees.
The user is fully responsible for any issues arising from using the project.

## Flashing images

Find the sdcard image or archive with fastboot images [here](https://github.com/GloDroidCommunity/pine64-pinephone/releases)

Use the SDCard raw image to flash the Android into SDCard.

Or use the fastboot images archive to download Android on SDCard or EMMC using fastboot mode:  

### Step 1
Extract the content of the archive.  
Using any available iso-to-usb utility, prepare recovery SDCARD.  
To flash Android on a sdcard, use *deploy-sd.img*  
To flash Android on eMMC, use *deploy-sd-for.emmc.img*  
  
### Step 2
Ensure you have installed the adb package: ```$ sudo apt install adb``` (required to set up udev rules)  
Insert recovery sdcard into the phone.  
Connect the phone and your PC using a typec cable.  
Power up the phone. Blue LED indicates that the phone is in bootloader mode, and you can proceed with flashing.  
  
### Step 3
Run .*/flash-sd.sh* utility for flashing Android to sdcard or *./flash-emmc.sh* for flashing Android to eMMC  
  
*After several minutes flashing should complete, and Android should boot*  

## Building from sources

Before building, ensure your system has at least 32GB of RAM, a swap file is at least 8GB, and 300GB of free disk space available.
We recommend using the latest laptops to get good performance. E.g., the HP ENVY x360 model15-ds1083cl takes about 5 hours to build the project.  

### Install system packages
(Ubuntu 22.04 LTS is only supported. Building on other distributions can be done using docker)
<br/>

- [Install AOSP required packages](https://source.android.com/setup/build/initializing).
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y git-core gnupg flex bison build-essential zip curl zlib1g-dev gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 lib32ncurses5-dev x11proto-core-dev libx11-dev lib32z1-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libxml2-utils xsltproc unzip fontconfig
```

<br/>

- Install additional packages
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y swig libssl-dev flex bison device-tree-compiler mtools git gettext libncurses5 libgmp-dev libmpc-dev cpio rsync dosfstools kmod gdisk lz4 meson cmake libglib2.0-dev git-lfs
```

<br/>

- Install additional packages (for building mesa3d, libcamera, and other meson-based components)
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip pkg-config python3-dev ninja-build
sudo pip3 install mako jinja2 ply pyyaml
```

- Install the `repo` tool
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python-is-python3 wget
wget -P ~/bin http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo
chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
```

**NOTE: After this step, you may need to log out and log in to the system to make $HOME/bin added to the PATH environment variable.**

### Fetching the sources and building the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GloDroidCommunity/pine64-pinephone.git
cd pine64-pinephone
```

### Building AOSP

```bash
./unfold_aosp.sh && ./build.sh
```

**NOTE: If you're using `git` for the first time, it may ask you to configure the user name and email address and confirm the colored terminal.
Please follow the suggestion you see on the screen in this case.**

### Building LineageOS

To enable GMS (microg), set the environment variable `export WITH_GMS=true`.

```bash
./unfold_lineageos.sh && ./build.sh
```

### Notes

- Depending on your hardware and internet connection, downloading and building may take 8h or more.  
- After the successful build, find the fastboot images at `./out/images.tar.gz` or sdcard image at `./out/sdcard.img`.
- To disable GloDroid's prebuild apps (like skytube, Firefox, etc.), set the environment variable before building `export GD_NO_DEFAULT_APPS=true`.
